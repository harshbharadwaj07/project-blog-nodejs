# Blog
A blog website designed using node.js, express.js and mongodb.

## User has functionality to:

(i) see posts from the members of the community; 
(ii) compose desired posts; 
(iii) comment to the posts made by a user in the community; 
(iv) view their posts; and 
(iv) delete their post.

## Using the web-app:

(i) Community Posts: Users can see posts by the members of the community on the 'Home' page.

(ii) Composing Posts: Users can compose their desired posts by using the 'Compose' button on the 'Home' page and submitting the desired title and content from the 'Compose' page.

(iii) Comments: Users can write comments to the posts made by a user in the community.

(iv) My Posts: Users can view their posts by clicking the 'My Posts' button on the home page.

(v) Deleting Posts: Users can delete their post(s) by clicking the 'Delete' button in the 'My Posts' section.

In future, I plan including liking, searching and rating posts.
